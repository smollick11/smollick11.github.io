        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Simon Mollick and I am a vision-driven creative professional with a strong background in photography, graphic design, and interactive media. My experience working on my high school yearbook staff ignited my love for capturing dynamic moments, particularly in sports photography and videography. Currently, I am furthering my expertise by pursuing a degree in Interactive Media Technology at Indian Hills Community College.</p>
    
    <p>Professionally, I have gained valuable experience in both creative and administrative roles. As a Reception and Media Graphic Designer at All Ages Pediatrics, I have honed my skills in graphic design, media creation, and administrative support. I design promotional materials, manage social media content, and assist in medical office operations. Additionally, my time at McDonald’s taught me essential customer service and teamwork skills, helping me build confidence in communication and problem-solving.</p>
    
    <p>Growing up, I have also been actively involved in my family's business, Joe’s Carpet Barn, where I developed a strong work ethic, sales acumen, and physical labor skills. These experiences have shaped me into a reliable, adaptable, and hardworking individual who thrives in fast-paced environments.</p>
    
    <p>With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence, I am eager to explore opportunities in professional sports photography, videography, and multimedia design. My goal is to combine my technical skills with my creative vision to produce compelling visual content that tells a story.</p>
